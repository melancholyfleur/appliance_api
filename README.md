===============

A simple app displaying a good sample of rails and UI skills

## Setup

```
$ bundle install
$ rake db:setup
$ rails server
```
## TODO

1. The other project of significance is trending appliances and targets totals over time. In order to do that one, though, I’d have to adjust the db/seeds.rb script to vary the created_at / updated_at entries. I didn’t get that far, but I thought timecop could help.
2. make charts js labels work
3. Tests!
